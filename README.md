# <h1 style="text-align: center">User Account Management Example Application with Spring Boot</h1>
## Overview

This is a simple web application that demonstrates user authentication and account management using Spring Boot. The application allows users to sign up for a new account or sign in to an existing one. It features a "remember me" option.

This application can serve as a starting point for developers who want to build user authentication and account management functionality into their own Spring Boot-based web applications. With its basic features, it is also a good option for those who are new to Spring Boot or web development in general and want to learn how to build a simple web application.

## Features

1. User authentication: Users can sign up for a new account or sign in to an existing one.
2. "Remember me" option: Users can choose to have their login session persist even after they close their browser.

3. Account details management: Users can see their account details, such as their email address or password.
6. Responsive design: The application is designed to be mobile-friendly and work well on devices of different sizes.

7. Secure: The application uses best practices for authentication and authorization to ensure that user data is protected.

###  I am excited to showcase my demo app that highlights the core functionality of a typical web application. However, I understand that each business has its own unique requirements, which is why I am offering additional features such as forgot password, email verification, password change, user detail change, admin panel, and many more based on your specific needs. I can work with you to customize and add any additional features to the app to make it a perfect fit for your business.
